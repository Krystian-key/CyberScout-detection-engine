Concept: CyberScout - Browser Extension for Proactive Cybersecurity Awareness and Defense

Overview:
A browser extension that provides real-time feedback on the safety and trustworthiness of websites,
and educates users about potential cyber threats using advanced AI-powered detection methods and powerful detection engine.

Key Features:

Real-Time Website Verification:
Upon visiting a site, the extension verifies the website's domain against a constantly
updated database of known malicious sites. It also scans the site for patterns and behaviors typical of phishing or malware-laden sites.

Phishing Email Link Checker:
If the user clicks on a link in an email, the extension checks the origin of the email and the destination website,
warning the user if the link seems suspicious or is known to be malicious, and blocking if users opens malicious link.

Interactive User Training:
Instead of just flagging a site as risky, the extension can provide a pop-up mini-lesson explaining why a site or action is deemed unsafe.
This empowers users with knowledge, making them less likely to fall for scams in the future.

Password Health Checker:
Many breaches occur because of weak passwords. This feature evaluates the strength of user passwords and recommends changes.
It can also alert users if their password is found in a data breach.

Integrated Secure Search:
The extension offers a built-in search function that emphasizes safe and verified results.
It helps users avoid accidentally visiting harmful websites.

Supply-Chain Attack Awareness:
Warns users if they are about to download software or extensions from vendors that have recently been compromised or are known to be risky.

Data Breach Alerts:
If a user has an account on a website that has recently suffered a data breach, the extension will alert them and advise on next steps.

Privacy Mode:
Ensures that while browsing, user data is not unnecessarily shared, minimizing the risk of data leakage or breaches.

Monetization: Offer a freemium model where basic features are free, but advanced protection,
such as high-frequency database updates, and integrations come with a subscription fee.
